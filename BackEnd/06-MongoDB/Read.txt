                       // Starting Instructions//
01:first start server by write 'mongod'
02:Then in new tab write 'mongosh' for start shell to interact with  mongodb  database on our local system using the command line.

// 'help' command is used for show basics commands.
//'show dbs' command show all the dbs
//'use databaseName' if db exist then we can now use it with the synonym of 'db', and if it's not exist then it's created and we use it.
//if new database is created then it's not show in the list of 'show dbs' b/c it has'nt any content, so when i add content in it, then it show in 'show dbs' list.
//for drop db, first we enter in that db by 'use dbName', then write 'db.dropDatabase()'
//if you want to show in which db are you currently in, then write 'db'
//MongoDB have 2 things: 
    1:Collection(group of documents,just like table in sql)
    2:Document(It's just a obj, just like a record in sql)

                                //CRUD operation//
                                //CREATE//
//there are 2 methods for Create:
    1:db.collectionName.insertOne({obj});
    2:db.collectionName.insertMany([{obj},{obj},...]);
    Note:if collection isn't exist,then by writing this command it auto. created.
